                The Blood Rooms can only be entered by those who killed members of their own species in the Frontrooms, as those members are seen by those who enter when they run from something from the Backrooms that scared them away, with missing eyes and an upside down smile. This is when other members of that species, who wear masks and stylish robes, are going to pull the enterer agaisnt a wall and make them no-clip into the Blood Rooms.

                    "Blood Rooms" is an enigmatic level of the Backrooms with red and black walls, floor and celing and yellow, orange and orangered chandlears as the only light sources naturaly found. There are rooms where blood forms pudles, there are those where it is just splashed all over the surfaces and ones with actual little rivers floating trough their interior, entirely blood-made little rivers. The staircases eventually found use to be more in the dry side, though being made of blood-colored concrete, but it is definitely not rare for their steps to be splashed with blood, so, be carefull not to trip. I mean, this is one of the ways to get sent to another - aparently random - level, but they do not work everytime, so, I would not go trying it.

                    "Boild Ones" are those very tall, skiny and dark humanoids that stand in some square shaped rooms, doing absolutely no movement until a visitor walks near them. The scream released when a boild one is aproached is low in vibration, but, in volume, is high enough to be heard from ten rooms away. They rise their armas while sprinting twords a level visitor twice as fast as humans use to sprint when we are scared away, and attempt bitting and sucking their blood as the more agressive versions of vampires are imagined.

                    "Old Ladys" look like the exteriotype of a wich and carry around the corpese of any human who they find until it decays into bone meal, provided they had not undergone puberty before dying.
